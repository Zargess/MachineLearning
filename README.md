# MachineLearning
<b>General machine learning library for F#</b>

Currently in pre alfpha state. No working code as of yet.

<b>Windows only as of now.</b>

This library is intentet to include as many types of Machine Learning as possiple and make it easier to quickly create a program which uses machine learning.

Current work is centered arround:
<ul>
  <li> Single agent reinforcement learning </li>
  <li> Multi agent reinforcement learning </li>
</ul>

Later work will be focused arround structured Machine Learning.


Plans for the library:
<ul>
  <li>Complete cross platform</li>
  <li>All central algorithms implemented in a general and reusable fashion</li>
</ul>
