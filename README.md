# MachineLearning
<b>General machine learning library for F#</b>

Currently in pre alfpha state. Only two algorithms completed as of yet.

<b>Windows only as of now.</b>

This library is intentet to include as many types of Machine Learning as possiple and make it easier to quickly create a program which uses machine learning.

Current work is centered arround:
<ul>
  <li> Structured machine learning algorithms </li>
  <li> Documentation for the completed work such that others might use it </li>
</ul>

Completed work:
<ul>
  <li> Single agen Q learning algorithm </li>
  <li> K Nearest Neighbours algorithm </li>
</ul>

Plans for the library:
<ul>
  <li>Complete cross platform with no ties to .Net</li>
  <li>All central algorithms implemented in a general and reusable fashion</li>
</ul>

Look at the MachineLearningTest project to see examples of use.

Q-learning examples:
<ul>
  <li>Fastest route</li>
  <li>TicTacToe</li>
</ul>

K Nearest Neighbours examples:
<ul>
  <li>DatingSite</li>
  <li>Digit</li>
</ul>
